GIS project

# Data
Data were sourced from iNaturalist.
Data were refined: only research-grade data and Phoenicopterus roseus observations were used.
6661 data points were plotted (refined from 10 000).

# Mapping
Both a static map and an interactive map were rendered.
Suspicious/vagrant observations (outside of the accepted range) were singled out.
